What is a Thread in Java?
= A thread in Java is the (direction or path) that is taken while a program is being 
executed.

=A thread is a thread of execution in a program

==direction or path


What is thread with example?
Image result for define thread in java
==Thread is often referred to as a lightweight process. 

==The process can be split down into so many threads. 
For example, in a browser, many tabs can be viewed as threads. 
==MS Word uses many threads - formatting text from one thread, processing input from 
 another thread, etc.

((Bean))

In Spring, the objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by
 the Spring IoC container are called beans.

((Component)

==Spring Component annotation is used to denote a class as Component. 
==It means that Spring framework will autodetect these classes for dependency injection 
when annotation-based configuration and classpath scanning is used.

What is the difference between @bean and @component in Spring?
==The @Bean annotation is a method-level annotation, 
==whereas @Component is a class-level annotation. 
==The @Component annotation doesn't need to be used with the @Configuration
 annotation, whereas the @Bean annotation has to be used within a class annotated with 
 @Configuration .

((MVC))

=Spring MVC is a Java framework that is used to develop web applications.

==develop web applications

MVC
The steps are as follows:

=Load the spring jar files or add dependencies in the case of Maven.
=Create the controller class.
=Provide the entry of controller in the web.xml file.
=Define the bean in the separate XML file.
=Display the message in the JSP page.
=Start the server and deploy the project.

==add dependencies.
==Create the controller class.
==entry..controller in the web.xml file.
==Define the bean in the separate XML file.
==Display the message in the JSP page.
==Start the server and deploy the project.(deployment==ನಿಯೋಜನೆ)


Design Pattern

=The Spring framework uses the factory design pattern for the creation of the object of
 beans by using the following two approaches.
=Spring BeanFactory Container: – It is the simplest container present in the 
spring framework which provides the basic support for DI (Dependency Injection).

(Servalet)

=Simply put, a Servlet is a class that handles requests, processes them and reply 
back with a response.

=For example, we can use a Servlet to collect input from a user through an HTML form,
 query records from a database, and create web pages dynamically.
