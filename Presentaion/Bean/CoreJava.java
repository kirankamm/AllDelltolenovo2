=Change the value in Method: Java supports only call by value. So, if we pass a primitive
 value, it will not change the original value. 
 =But, if we convert the primitive value in an object, it will change the original value.

=Serialization: We need to convert the objects into streams to perform the serialization. If we have a primitive value, we can convert it in objects through the wrapper classes.
Synchronization: Java synchronization works with objects in Multithreading.

java.util package: The java.util package provides the utility classes to deal with 
objects.
Collection Framework: Java collection framework works with objects only.
 All classes of the collection framework (ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, HashSet,
 LinkedHashSet, TreeSet, PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque, etc.) deal with objects only.


Unboxing
The automatic conversion of wrapper type into its corresponding primitive type is known
 as unboxing. It is the reverse process of autoboxing. Since Java 5, we do not need to 
 use the intValue() method of wrapper classes to convert the wrapper type into primitives
 .



There are six ways to create an object in Java.

1: Create Object in Java Using new Keyword.
2: Create Object in Java Using newInstance() method.
3: Create Object in Java Using newInstance() method of Constructor Class.
4: Create Object in Java Using clone() Method.
5: Create Object in Java Using Deserialization Method.
